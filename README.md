# Convolutional Neural Network: Blood Cells Classification

This project was developed for the course of **Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning** for the MSc. in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, A.Y. 2024/2025.

## Overview
The goal of the project was to develop a CNN for the classification of blood cells images. Our model achieved an accuracy of 0.82 on a hidden set.

## Table of Contents
- [`Final_Model.ipynb`](Notebooks/Final_Model.ipynb) is the main file that computes training and fine-tuning of the model and evaluates its performance on train, validation and test set.
- [`Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`](Notebooks/Data_Preprocessing.ipynb) provides the implementation of the code to explore and preprocess the dataset.
- [`Models_Comparison.ipynb`](Notebooks/Models_Comparison.ipynb) contains the code to test different models by performing transfer learning on different pretrained models.
- [`Optimizers_Comparison.ipynb`](Notebooks/Optimizers_Comparison.ipynb) contains the code to test different models by performing transfer learning with the use of different optimizers.
